# vuejs-composition-api

## Project setup

See https://github.com/lmiller1990/vuejs-composition-api-course

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build
```

### Run your unit tests

```
yarn test:unit
```

## Unresolved Findings

### Sourcemap in unit tests does not work

- No stop at some breakpoints
- Sometime "steps out" from ts code into cjs.js code e.g. `runtime-core.cjs.js`

### Console output in jest test is sometimes not shown

TBD

### Adding a vue component to jest expect gives endless recursion

`expect([errorCallParams: [Error, (Vue)Component, string]]...`

## Resolved Findings

### @/ as replacement for ./src

```ts
import { today, thisWeek, thisMonth } from "@/mock"
```

### source-map support for vue components in browser

See [configureWebpack section in ./vue.config.js](./vue.config.js#L6)

### ts-essentials delivers DeepReadonly and DeepWritable

Ever wanted to implement the design pattern "Prototype"? Note that the prototype is then immutable at TS design time only, not at runtime.

### Mock Rest Services with Mock Service Worker

See https://github.com/mswjs/msw

### DO-NOT use JSON.stringify->JSON.parse for deep cloneing

See https://flaviocopes.com/how-to-clone-javascript-object/#json-serialization states

> By doing this you will lose any Javascript property that has no equivalent type in JSON, like Function or Infinity. Any property thatâ€™s assigned to undefined will be ignored by JSON.stringify, causing them to be missed on the cloned object.
>
> Also, some objects are converted to strings, like Date objects for example (also, not taking into account the timezone and defaulting to UTC), Set, Map and many others: ...

### vue's nextTick() vs vue-util's flushPromises()

nextTick only flushes vue promises. flushPromises also flushes all other promises.

### import of vue component must end with .vue

Example: `import Home from "@/components/Home.vue"`

### Vs-code volar extension misses code completion for vue-router

See

- https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar, "Define Global Components"
- https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/issues/547#issuecomment-932773344

### Where is `this.$options` gone?

See https://v3.vuejs.org/api/composition-api.html#getcurrentinstance

```ts
import { getCurrentInstance } from "vue"
console.log(getCurrentInstance()?.proxy?.$options.__scopeId)
```

### What does `[Vue warn]: Extraneous non-emits...` mean

```
runtime-core.esm-bundler.js:6551 [Vue warn]: Extraneous non-emits event listeners (save) were passed to component but could not be automatically inherited because component renders fragment or text root nodes. If the listener is intended to be a component custom event listener only, declare it using the "emits" option.
```

Means: The emitting component misses an emit declaration.

### v-model on component, a most confusing construct

See https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/v-model.html

> BREAKING: When used on custom components, v-model prop and event default names are changed:
>
> - prop: value -> modelValue;
> - event: input -> update:modelValue;

See https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-basics.html#using-v-model-on-components

> ```ts
> <custom-input v-model="searchText" />
> ```
>
> When used on a component, v-model instead does this:
>
> ```ts
> <custom-input
>   :model-value="searchText"
>   @update:model-value="searchText = $event"
> </custom-input>
> ```
>
> For this to actually work though, the \<input\> inside the component must:
>
> - Bind the `value` attribute to the `modelValue` prop
> - On input, emit an `update:modelValue` event with the new value
>
> ```ts
> app.component("custom-input", {
>   props: ["modelValue"],
>   emits: ["update:modelValue"],
>   template: `
>    <input
>      :value="modelValue"
>      @input="$emit('update:modelValue', $event.target.value)"
>     >
>   `,
> })
> ```

### How to check for uncaught error in a vue component test?

```ts
it("it baz", async (done) => {
  let globalErrorSpy = jest.fn()
  ...
  const wrapper = mount(NewPost, {
    global: {
      plugins: [initialStoreCopy],
      config: { errorHandler: globalErrorSpy },
    },
  })
  wrapper.find("[foo='bar'").trigger("click")
  // needed!
  await flushPromises()
  // needed!
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 500))
  //
  expect(globalErrorSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  //
  let error: Error = globalErrorSpy.mock.calls[0][0]
  expect(error).toBeInstanceOf(Error)
  expect(error).toHaveProperty("message", "Network Error")
  expect(globalErrorSpy.mock.calls[0][2]).toBe("component event handler")
  done()
})
```

### How to debug jest test via vue-cli-service in vs code

1. Open a Javascript Debug Terminal
2. Run therein

```
node ./node_modules/.bin/vue-cli-service test:unit --runInBand --no-cache --coverage false
```

P.S. `--no-cache` and `--coverage false` do provide better sourcemap compatibility.

### How to use an inject/provide object inside the router

To receive the inject/provide object, the object must be an argument to a function, which is returning the so configured router. Essentially one must do function parameter binding.

### useRoute/useRouter return undefined if called before/after an await

See https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next/issues/257

> In the following situation, useRoute will work because it's called before the await, while
> useRouter will not work because it's called after the await.

### How do you JSON.stringify an ES6 Map?

See https://stackoverflow.com/a/56150320

### Fix 'SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'

Cause was a cyclic dependency(main<.ts <-> store.ts) which eneded up in this test havoc. Extracted function to utils.ts, which is ok.

### Failed to resolve component: router-link

Add

```
...
    global: {
        ...
        components: {
            // Fixes "Failed to resolve component: router-link"
                RouterLink: {
                template: `<div></div>`,
            },
    },
    ...
```

to MountingOptions.

### Setup vue router in unit test

```
const router = ...
router.push(`/posts/${today.id}`)
// Returns a Promise that resolves when the router has completed the initial navigation
await router.isReady()
```
